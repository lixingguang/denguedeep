# Dengue Project Goals 

## Purpose
This project helps the government of Malaysia make use of their public dataset on dengue (mosquito-borne disease) to predict future outbreaks using machine learning and GIS tools.

## Approach
1. subset data - get locations -done
2. divide data by state locations for analysis -done
3. structure data by date (week or month) - done
2. exploratory plots - hist - done
3. plot gis -heatmap - done
4. plot time series data for each state
4. add data 
	- rainfall, 
	- month, - done
	- weather / temp
	- humidity
	- week/date - done
	- duration -done
5. percent of population infected?
6. what are the variables  correlated with incidence?
7. calc probability incidence
8. measure error from test set
